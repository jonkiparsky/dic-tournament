#summary Schedule/To-do list/dependencies


= Introduction =

A rough list of things that need to be done. This should become an ordered list of tasks. It would be nice to have two views on this: one showing dependencies, one showing a sort of "release timetable" (by features, not by calendar)

= To do list =
  * redefine the contract for the player interface - *in progress (RS)*
  * annotateMove() method
  * updateEachPlayer() method
  * Game communication to Player - *in progress (RS)*
  * statistics  (rough framework)
  * presentable statistics report
  * statistics: architecture
  * administrivia: loading Players - *rough copy (JPK)*
  * administrivia: user interface for Tournament
  * generating/naming player IDs - *in progress (RS)*
  * game mechanics need work
  * security of moves

Every N revisions: 
  * review and re-finalize interfaces and bottom-level abstract classes

= Timeline To Do =
  * Make decision on player contract
  * Make decision on statistics architecture
    * Are we collecting data only through annotateMove() now?
  * Statistics Framework
    * annotateMove() in Game
  * Game mechanics
    * Game communication with Player
      * updateEachPlayer() and Game control flow
    * Ensure Move security
  * Load players with proper IDs
