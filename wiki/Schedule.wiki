#summary Schedule/To-do list/dependencies


= Introduction =

A rough list of things that need to be done. This should become an ordered list of tasks. It would be nice to have two views on this: one showing dependencies, one showing a sort of "release timetable" (by features, not by calendar)

= To do =
  * redefine the contract for the player interface
  * annotateMove() method
  * Game communication to Player
  * statistics  (rough framework)
  * presentable statistics report
  * statistics: architecture
  * administrivia: loading Players
  * administrivia: user interface for Tournament
  * generating/naming player IDs
  * game mechanics need work
  * security of moves

Every N revisions: 
  * review and re-finalize interfaces and bottom-level abstract classes
