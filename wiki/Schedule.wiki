#summary Schedule/To-do list/dependencies


= Introduction =

A rough list of things that need to be done. This should become an ordered list of tasks. It would be nice to have two views on this: one showing dependencies, one showing a sort of "release timetable" (by features, not by calendar)

= To do =
Game communication to Player
statistics
presentable statistics report
statistics: architecture
administrivia: loading Players
administrivia: user interface for Tournament
generating/naming player IDs
game mechanics need work
security of moves
