#summary Schedule/To-do list/dependencies


= Introduction =

A rough list of things that need to be done. This should become an ordered list of tasks. It would be nice to have two views on this: one showing dependencies, one showing a sort of "release timetable" (by features, not by calendar)

= To do list =
  * redefine the contract for the player interface
  * annotateMove() method
  * updateEachPlayer() method
  * Game communication to Player
  * statistics  (rough framework)
  * presentable statistics report
  * statistics: architecture
  * administrivia: loading Players - needs revision
  * administrivia: user interface for Tournament - needs revision
  * generating/naming player IDs
  * game mechanics need work
  * security of moves
  * logging - should we plan on wiring in some logging?

Every N revisions: 
  * review and re-finalize interfaces and bottom-level abstract classes

= Timeline To Do =
  * Make decision on player contract *done*
  * Make decision on statistics architecture
    * Are we collecting data only through annotateMove() now?
  * Statistics Framework
    * annotateMove() in Game
  * Game mechanics *done*
    * Game communication with Player *done*
      * updateEachPlayer() and Game control flow *done*
    * Ensure Move security
  * Load players with proper IDs
  * administrivia: user interface for Tournament:
    * allow choice of games
    * allow choice of 
      * "test" - human vs choice of player
      * "all" - play all players against each other, SKIPPING human
      * play selected players (free choice)
    * self-play, or no
    * total permutation or elimination tournament
    *  (not all options need to be implemented immediately)
    *  (in fact, very little of this needs to be implemented immediately)

= Milestones =
  # (1.0 ?) Be able to run Tournament and receive a screen report() from the Game's DataReader. (This implies we have a working Tournament where are parts are functional and doing their job, though at a very basic level.)
